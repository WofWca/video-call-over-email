  <p>Warning: the video data you send is as persistent as text messages you send, so don't do anything embarassing, even if there is no one else on the call at the moment</p>
  <p>As of 2023-11-15, sending video won't work on unmodified Delta Chat clients</p>
  <p>The delay is <i>at least</i> 10 seconds, so you gotta wait a bit</p>
